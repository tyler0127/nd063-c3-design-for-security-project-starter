Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. S3.4 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
2. S3.5 S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer
3. EC2.9 EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
4. EC2.8 EC2 instances should use Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2)

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. To enable default encryption on the S3 bucket
2. Update the permissions policy of the S3 bucket to allow SSL requests only.
3. Disassociating the Elastic IP address from Web Service Instance.
4. Configure the instance metadata service to solve the issue.
